# Bootleg Mine Map of Schuylkill County (1937)

In 1937, the state government created a commission to study bootleg  coal. They launched an extensive survey to map out bootleg coal  operations in Schuylkill and Northumberland counties, using airplane and employing 20 unemployed miners to go site to site. They had the  cooperation of the Independent Miners’ Association and most coal  bootleggers.

Published in 1938, the commission found 7,000 [people](https://www.bootlegcoal.com/women-were-always-in-on-it/) working together in 1,129 illegal mines across Schuylkill,  Northumberland, Columbia, and Dauphin counties. They estimated another  250 coal holes existed in Carbon, Luzerne, and Lackawanna counties.  Another 1,300 worked in small breakers and 2,700 truckers ran the coal  to market.

Approximately 2/3rd of all bootleg mines were in Schuylkill County.  Below, you can see the commission’s map of active bootleg mines in there in late 1937.
