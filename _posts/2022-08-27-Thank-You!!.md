Thank you so much to everyone that came out to book release events  this August. Five events in four days! It was a powerful experience. I  talked to nearly every person who came out and heard countless stories  that were inspirational, harrowing, surprising, funny, or touching. Iâ€™ll be doing more events soon (see [events page](https://www.bootlegcoal.com/events-2/)).

If youâ€™ve read some or part of the book, please **leave an honest review** online, be in [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Bootleg-Coal-Rebellion-Pennsylvania-1925-1942/dp/1629639338/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2Z5LU3QWR1RY&keywords=bootleg+coal+rebellion&qid=1662131188&sprefix=bootle%2Caps%2C870&sr=8-1), [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58603652-the-bootleg-coal-rebellion), social mediaâ€“anywhere really. You could even it on paper and hang it at the post office ðŸ¤£. Iâ€™m also looking for some help getting the book sold locally in **stores**, especially community hubs like corner stores and diners. If you have  suggestions & contacts, please get in touch. I want the book to be  where people can find it, especially for people who donâ€™t read often.  Iâ€™ve been getting a lot of requests asking where people can buy it and  Iâ€™d like to have a list to point people towards.

The story of the bootleg miners is profound, and Iâ€™d like to get some **historic markers** set up to recognize them. Nearly every town in the lower coal region  has events that could be marked and commemorated. All it takes is a  group of people and a little bit of work. If you know some people whoâ€™d like to work on that, get in touch. It requires doing a petition, some fundraising, some paperwork, and a dedication ceremony.

None of them were possible without the help of many, many people. **Thanks to**: SJ @ Mondragon, Mary Anne Troutman my #1 bookseller, Roxie Rothermal,  Lewisburg First Presbyterian, Trevorton Rec Committee, John Bostwick,  Keith Troutman, Phoebe Heath @ Anthracite Creative Works, Jaime Levi,  Stevie Blyler Photography, Brandon Kopinetz @ the Washington Hotel, Jim @ Minersville Area Historical Society, George Maroukis & Heather,  Hope & Coffee in Tamaqua, Pioneer Tunnel in Ashland, the  Northumberland County Fair, Jamie Longazel @ Anthracite Unite, and Mark  Lawrence @ WKOK.
