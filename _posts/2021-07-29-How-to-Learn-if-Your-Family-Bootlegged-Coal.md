Five+ years ago when I started this book, I thought my only  connection to the bootleg miners was growing up around a few of them.  Eventually I learned I was wrong, and I’m a descendent of more than one  bootlegger. My PA Dutch pappy didn’t really know what I was talking  about until I showed him some photos from the book. That took him down  memory lane to the 1930s and early 1940s, when his older brother ran the winch at the family coal hole outside Gowen City, illegally dug and  operated on land probably owned by Reading Anthracite.

Most people in Schuylkill and Northumberland Counties were involved  with bootleg coal. When the mines closed, illegal mining became the main source of income in coal towns, alongside textile work. Most people  were burning bootleg in their homes. Town halls, schools, fire stations, churches, and even the county jails were burning bootleg coal. That  cash went straight into the local economy, bypassing Wall Street.  Merchants, doctors, newspapers, and nearly every other business were  paid with bootlegging coal money. Unfortunately, the US caught a  collective case of amnesia after World War II—people were ashamed of  their desperation during the Depression and were afraid of being linked  to communists, so many families never learned what their ancestors had  done to survive (except for those who returned and kept bootlegging—some til this day!)

## Draft Cards

There was never any master list of coal bootleggers, of course, but  by the mid-Depression they operated in broad daylight. So when the World War II draft rolled out, [at least 500](https://www.ancestry.com/search/collections/2238/?f-Self-Military-Occupation=independent+miner&f-Self-Military-Occupation_x=1&residence=_pennsylvania-usa_41&residence_x=_1-0) people weren’t afraid to write “Independent Miner” as their occupation. You can [find these draft cards at ancestry.com](https://www.ancestry.com/search/collections/2238/), which is unfortunately paywalled even though this is a collection of  government records (you’ve got to pay the Mormons who run the site,  sorry). This is also a good record for learning about someone’s physical health—a remarkable number of bootleggers were 5’8′ or taller but  weighed only 140 lbs!

## Accidents

Miners and truckers kept membership and dues rolls from the  bootleggers’ unions, but sadly these were all destroyed to protect the  guilty. What’s left, then, are the **accident reports in local newspapers**—typically only for severe or fatal accidents. Company miners were union and had  incentive to report minor injuries, but bootleggers avoided the hospital unless there was no other choice—and even then some of them still  didn’t go!

You can find local newspapers at your local library or historical  society, although unless they are digitized you can’t search them. The  best place to look is newspapers.com (requires a membership, or a  membership to ancestry.com). The Shamokin News-Dispatch and Porterville  Republican were the most thorough about reporting these, but you should  also try searching more local papers. There were thousands of fatalities during the Depression. I suggest putting the person’s name in quotes  (“Earl Humphreys”) to link the words together, and then add “bootleg” to your search. Alternatively, try “Independent Mine.”

**Arrest and court records** may also exist, but none  that I know of are in a searchable database, meaning you would need to  know the exact record you are looking for in order to find it. Your best bet is to contact the county or municipality you believe the record is  in to see if they have it archived.

Please share what you find!
