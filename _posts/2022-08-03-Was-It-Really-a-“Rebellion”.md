> “*My brother had a coal hole, on the Reading ground. They blew his hole  shut. That was it! Things got rough then… They had to let the people  make a living or there would have been a civil war. Reading bought that  ground for four dollars an acre… How in the hell? … Four dollars an  acre! … It was the people’s ground. That’s the way we figured. We were  digging our own coal. We owned the land! Land of the free!*”

In books and writing, titles usually come last. After completing the  book I could think of no better title than calling it exactly what it  was: the Bootleg Coal Rebellion. Is that hyperbolic, exaggeration? What  specifically makes this a rebellion? The book itself is relatively free  of abstract arguments like this one, focusing instead on the narrative  itself, but the question has been asked and this seems like a good place to answer it.

Each dictionary has its own definition of Rebellion, and usually more than one. I’ll give you two and show how they apply, or not, to the  bootleggers.

According to [Dictionary.Com](https://web.archive.org/web/20201109040718/https://www.dictionary.com/browse/rebellion): “**open, organized, and armed resistance to one’s government or ruler**.”

A stricter definition from [Meriam-Webster](https://web.archive.org/web/20210830072930/https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rebellion): “**open, armed, and usually unsuccessful defiance of or resistance to an established government**“

**Open**: The bootleggers began at night, but as their  numbers grew, they shifted to broad daylight. By 1934, they formed  unions to organize their activities, speak on their behalf, fight legal  battles. By 1935, they held open negotiations with coal companies and  the state government.

**Organized**: The primary focus of the book is how the  bootleggers organized themselves. So, to give just a few examples here:  Mines were to be spaced 100′ apart but linked for ventilation. Coal  would be sold at a standard rate, and they carried out strikes when  those rates were violated. Miners, truckers, and breakers all paid dues  to local bootleg unions, which kept record of who had and had not paid.  Truckers displayed emblems to show they were up-to-date. This is the tip of the iceberg.

**Armed**: Bootleggers almost never  brought firearms into the conflict, and when they did their leaders  often told them to go home. They were, however, armed with dynamite.  Through the years of 1929 – 1942, they dynamited at least one dozen  steam shovels and power shovels. The companies usually backed down after this, fearing where else the miners would place dynamite. Bootleggers  relied much more often on non-violent resistance, such as laying in  front of or inside of machinery. But they always did this with the  implicit threat that there could be violence.

**Resistance/Defiance**: The bootleggers of that time  believed they had to choose between their own communities and company  property rights. They chose themselves. Clearly this was in defiance of  the companies as well as some basic principals of the US government.  They resisted anyone who tried to enforce those property rights, be they Coal & Iron Police, state police, courts, or federal law.

The crux, then, is whether a rebellion is a failed revolution. The  vast majority of bootleggers didn’t want to overthrow the US government  (although the Communist bootleggers certainly did). However, various  government officials including Pennsylvania governors said that an  attempt to break up bootleg mining would result in civil war. For  instance, one federal official appointed to deal with coal bootlegging  said that the situation “*has become so serious as to amount to rebellion and civil war, which only the calling out of the National Guard can suppress.*”*

When an open, armed, organized force of people makes the government  is fears enforcing it’s own basic laws within its own territory, and  when they hold that ground for a decade, that is indeed a rebellion.
