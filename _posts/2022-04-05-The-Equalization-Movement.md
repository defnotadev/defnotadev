One winter, when work was scarce, one Panther Valley coal mine worked full-time for what felt like weeks on end. Rather than celebrate their  good fortune, they went on strike. See, miners in the next town over had not worked in weeks, and the strike was to force the coal company to  bring their neighbors back to work. Even if it dropped their own  earnings to poverty levels. The strike continued until men in the local  coal mines all shared an equal amount of work time. This was the  equalization movement.

The bosses didn’t like it. The union didn’t like it. But the miners  enforced it from below to keep their entire valley afloat through the  lean years of the Great Depression.

As the mines closed in the late 1920’s and early 1930’s, the demand  to share working time arose from rank-and-file miners across  Pennsylvania’s Anthracite Coal Region. United Mine Workers president  John L. Lewis opposed it, often times violently. The push for  equalization led to the expulsion of large numbers of Wilkes-Barre area  miners, who then formed their own union for employed and unemployed  alike. Bitter street battles erupted between factions, scores of people  were murdered, and the leader of the [rival (“rump”) union](https://www.nytimes.com/1933/11/05/archives/insurgents-call-hardcoal-strike-60000-workers-involved-in-demand.html) was [assassinated in his home on Good Friday](https://apnews.com/article/97c90bbc3edf4b05bcbe9442729b3ad0).

In the southern region, workers pushed for equalization inside the  UMW by day and took matters into their own hands at night—with bootleg  coal. Union locals launched various equalization strikes but were never  able to build the solidarity between employed and unemployed to do so  effectively. Eventually so few miners were employed that equalization  became impossible anyway. Zero divided by anything is still zero.

The Panther Valley is where the equalization movement triumphed. They went around the union, forming the Panther Valley Equalization  Committee (PVEC) with support and leadership from local clergy and  businessmen. Unlike the UMW, this community-labor organization had no  contract with the coal company to violate. The UMW turned a blind eye to the relatively small valley, given the strife they had already created  in their most crowded district.

Across 5 towns, over 10,000 people marched and struck to initiate the plan, forcing it on the coal companies. Smaller enforcement strikes  periodically balanced work-time between mines when the company refused.  The local newspaper ran a time-table so everyone could keep track.

> “The well-being and welfare of human beings is far more important than  profit, and should be given the right of way in the present emergency.  The so-called ‘high’ cost or lesser efficient collieries must be allowed to stay in business if the purpose of the NRA to get people back to  work and to increase the purchasing power of the people is to be  accomplished…

> “…is not the employment of the big army of idle  mine-workers of vastly greater importance to the nation than profit for  the few?”

Unlike the bootleggers, PVEC had political goals. They dominated the  local body of FDR’s National Recovery Administration and put pressure on the national NRA to incorporate equalization into the coal code. They  pushed for a 5-day, 30-hour workweek, and for the government to buy coal and distribute it as relief to the poor. PVEC’s president, newspaperman [James Gildea,](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/James_H._Gildea) was elected to US congress, where he was a friend of the bootleggers as well (although never without a little conflict).

Equalization did not leave people well-off, but it carried their  communities through the Depression united and without destitution. The  UMW grew soft to it later in the decade. As with so much else, World War II ended the movement as industry boomed and the draft sucked up young  labor. After the war, when the industry began its second collapse,  miners launched a new equalization fight which ended in sorrow rather  than solidarity. Because of this, equalization became a bitter idea that was soon forgotten by the following generations.

For the most complete telling of the Panther Valley story, see chapter 3 in [The Face of Decline: The Pennsylvania Anthracite Region in the Twentieth Century](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Face_of_Decline/XjMF7LP_JU0C?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PA59&printsec=frontcover) by Thomas Dublin and Walter Licht. Similar but unrelated(!)  equalization battles took place at the same time in Barberton, OH and  Woonsocket, RI.
